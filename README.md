# DynamicsGenerateNewAutoField

`CreateAutoNumberField` method has been commented out from main for safety.

When using this program, be prepared to have:
1. Your Organization Service URL found in the settings of your system.
2. Your credentials for accessing the system (in most cases your domain name and password).

Be aware that sometimes there could be problems if the **AuthType** in the connection string is not correct, troubleshoot with different types if you fail to get a connection and you believe the information from steps 1 & 2 are correct.
